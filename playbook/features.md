# LuminaOS Playbook - Features

If you are installing the playbook, you will be asked a few questions before the installation actually begins.

One of these questions is which **features** you want to have in the Playbook.

# Remove Microsoft Edge

This option will remove Microsoft Edge from your PC. You will be asked to select a replacement browser or keep yours later, so there's no point in not removing Edge.

# Remove OneDrive

This option will remove OneDrive from your PC. If you have important files on there, either uncheck the option or copy them over to something like a USB.

# Change wallpapers

This will replace the default Windows 11 wallpapers with Windows Server 2025 ones.
